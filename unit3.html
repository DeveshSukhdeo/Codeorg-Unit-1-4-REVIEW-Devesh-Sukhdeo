  <b>Lesson 6: Debugging</b>
  <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
  <!-- Q & A -->
  <p>
    <b>Question: </b> What is one thing you really enjoyed about today's activity?
    <br>
    Is there anything that you found confusing or need extra help with?
    <br>
    <b>Answer: </b> I enjoyed adding more to the existing code to make the page screen more interactive, especially on bubble 3 part C. Some parts that got me  confused are the parts where small errors that didn't seem important affected the code result so much. Eventually though, I was successfully able to find and fix these errors.
