      <b>Unit 1</b>
      <hr> 
      <p>In unit one we learned about the basics of html and digital information. We learned the proper steps to creating a webpage using html as well as many frequently used tags in html. Some of them being p which is the paragraph tag, body which is the body tag, h1 which is the largest heading tag, and more. In addition, we learned about binary numbers and how there are 8 bits in a byte. The final topics of unit one were rgb color and CSS, we learned to code a basic stylesheet and attach it to our html file.</p>

      <b>Unit 2</b>
      <hr>
      <p>In unit two we learned about the internet, about how it works and how it was created. Some of the topics we covered were computing networks and systems, bandwidth, IP (Internet protocols) and two different types of internet protocols. The two internet protocols we learned about were the user datagram protocol which focuses on speed and the transmission control protocol which focuses on accuracy. Nearing the end of this unit we learned about the digital divide which is the gap between people who have access to a reliable internet service and those who don't. This exemplifies how much the digital world affects people and the physical world around us.</p>

      <b>Unit 3</b>
      <hr>
      <p>
        In unit three we begin learning about how apps are created and about methods we could use to create our own apps. We learned about how an app needs to meet the userâ€™s needs while also being functional and free of bugs. Every app needs a user interface where the user will interact with the app as well as inputs and outputs which control everything that happens on the app and will dictate how successful the app is and how useful it can be to the user. During this unit we also begin learning the basics of JavaScript and the difference between sequential and event driven programming.</p>

      <b>Unit 4</b>
      <hr>
      <p>
        In unit four we learned about variables, conditionals and functions. We learned how a variable is a sort of digital container that holds information and how you should only declare a variable once, after it is declared you can call the variable wherever you need it. We also covered pseudo code which is plain language used to plan out an algorithm. Throughout this unit we learned a lot about javascript code and how to develop a functioning app using javascript. Nearing the end of this unit we did a project that required the use of conditionals, variables and functions to complete.</p>
